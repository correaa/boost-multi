In this example, we are going to use memory that is not managed by the library and manipulate the elements.
We can create a static C-array of `double`s, and refer to it via a bidimensional array `multi::array_ref<double, 2>`.

```cpp
#include <boost/multi/array.hpp>

namespace multi = boost::multi;

int main() {
	double d_data[20] = {
		150.0, 16.0, 17.0, 18.0, 19.0,
		 30.0,  1.0,  2.0,  3.0,  4.0,
		100.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0,
		 50.0,  6.0,  7.0,  8.0,  9.0
	};  // block of 20 elements ...
	multi::array_ref<double, 2> d2D_ref(&d_data[0], {4, 5});  // .. interpreted as a 4 by 5 array
	...
```

Next, we print the elements in a way that corresponds to the logical arrangement:

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // for print
	...
	auto [is, js] = d2D_ref.extensions();
	for(auto i : is) {
		for(auto j : js) {
			std::cout<< d2D_ref[i][j] <<' ';
		}
		std::cout <<'\n';
	}
```

This will output:

> ```
> 150 16 17 18 19
> 30 1 2 3 4
> 100 11 12 13 14
> 50 6 7 8 9
> ```

The arrays provide iterator-based access, which allows it to interface with algorithms and implement new ones.

It is sometimes said (by Sean Parent) that the whole of STL algorithms can be seen as intermediate pieces to implement `std::stable_sort`.
Presumably, if one can sort over a range, one can perform any other standard algorithm.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>  // for sort
	...
	std::stable_sort( d2D_ref.begin(), d2D_ref.end() );
```

If we print the result again, we get:

> ```
> 30 1 2 3 4
> 50 6 7 8 9
> 100 11 12 13 14
> 150 16 17 18 19
> ```

The array has been changed to be in row-based lexicographical order.
Since the sorted array is a reference to the original data, the original C-array has changed.

(Note that `std::sort` cannot be applied directly to a multidimensional C-array or to other libraries, such as Boost.MultiArray.
The library here are supports all STL algorithms directly.)

If we want to order the matrix on a per-column basis, we need to "view" the matrix as a range of columns.
This is done in the bidimensional case, by accessing the matrix as a range of columns:

```cpp
	...
	std::stable_sort( d2D_ref.rotated().begin(), d2D_ref.rotated().end() );
}
```

The `rotate` operation rotates indices, providing a new logical view of the original array without modifying it.

In this case, the original array will be transformed by sorting the matrix into:

> ```
> 1 2 3 4 30
> 6 7 8 9 50
> 11 12 13 14 100
> 16 17 18 19 150
> ```

By combining index rotations and transpositions, an array of dimension `D` can be viewed simultaneously as `D!` (D-factorial) different ranges of different "transpositions" (rotation/permutation of indices.)
